## Ethics

### Study 2 Interview Study:
Our study plans and data protection measures were thoroughly reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB) to safeguard against undue participant risk. Before the interview, all participants were asked to sign consent forms in which the goals of our study and data handling procedures were described. Those consent forms were stored securely and do not contain any links to the IDs we assigned to our participants. To protect participant anonymity, we implemented several measures to protect their identities throughout the research process.

- **Firstly**, although participants provided their email addresses when signing up through the registration link, these email addresses were used solely for the purpose of scheduling interviews. This limited the exposure of personal information and ensured that the email addresses were not associated with any research data.
- **Secondly**, during the data collection phase, we took additional steps to maintain confidentiality by recording pseudonyms instead of using participants' real names or any public identifiers. This approach ensured that the raw data collected could not be traced back to any individual participant. By dissociating personal identifiers from the data, we further minimized the risk of unintentional disclosure of participants' identities.
- All data were securely stored on a university server, accessible only to our team. Identifying details were removed or altered during analysis to prevent participant identification.

After the interview, participants received $20 or equivalent as compensation.

### Study 3 Online Discussion Data Analysis :
The collected Reddit data are publicly available; however, concerns about privacy, anonymity, and the discoverability of individuals within this data have been raised by researchers [98]. To align with the norms of the research community, we carefully reviewed relevant studies (e.g., [3, 21, 69]) to guide our data collection, analysis, and reporting practices, with a focus on protecting personally identifiable information. To achieve this, we employed several key practices:

- **Secure Data Storage**: All data was stored on a secure, password-protected server. We plan to delete individual observations upon publication of the study, retaining only the aggregate data necessary for replicating our findings.
- **Anonymization of Usernames**: Before conducting our analysis, we unlinked usernames from the data, ensuring that no identifying information was associated with the analyzed content.
- **Strict Search and Privacy Protocols**: We avoided using usernames to search for additional information about users during and after the study. Additionally, any quotes included in our paper were paraphrased to prevent the possibility of identifying users.
- **Protection of Example Comments**: In the online appendix, we provided posts examples in order to explain our methodology. These posts were paraphrased to ensure that they could not be traced back to the original Reddit accounts, either through search engines like Google or the Reddit search function.
