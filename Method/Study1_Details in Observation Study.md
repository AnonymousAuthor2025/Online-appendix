# Sample List For Sources of Information

We first examined the Ethereum Foundation’s introductions to stablecoins, and subsequently, we reviewed whitepapers and websites of notable stablecoin projects highlighted by the Ethereum Foundation. We explored the array of stablecoins listed on CoinMarketCap and discovered many notable projects, not only limited to those enumerated by Ethereum, such as USDT [^1] and Binance USD (BUSD) [^2] of fiat-backed stablecoins, LUSD [^3] and Magic Internet Money (MIM) [^4] of crypto-backed stablecoins, UST [^5] and FRAX [^6] of algorithmic stablecoins. 

The following provides an introduction to three resources:

1. **Stablecoin introductions by the Ethereum Foundation**  
   Examples: 
   - Why stablecoins: stablecoin definition and function
   - Find a stablecoin: show how to get stablecoins and stablecoin types
   - Use your stablecoins: stablecoin application in Dapps
   - How they work?

2. **Whitepapers and websites of stablecoin projects**  
   Examples: 
   - Why use Tether? 
   - How do they work? 
   - Widespread adoption

3. **Information of specific stablecoins from CoinMarketCap**  
   Examples: 
   - Price 
   - Market cap 
   - Total supply 
   - About: stablecoin introduction

# Stablecoin Framework Development

We used an inductive coding method to identify the issuance and use cases of stablecoins. From introductions from the Ethereum Foundation, we identified three common types of stablecoins:

- **Fiat-backed stablecoins** (e.g., USDC [^7])
- **Crypto-backed stablecoins** (e.g., DAI [^8])
- **Algorithmic stablecoins** (e.g., Ampleforth [^9])

Guided by these three stablecoin categories and based on market capitalization and descriptions from CoinMarketCap, we selected representative stablecoin projects for an in-depth analysis of their whitepapers. Taking fiat-backed stablecoin USDT as an example, its whitepaper delineates the stability mechanisms of USDT, its issuance process, and application scenarios, highlighting terms such as “1-to-1 basis”, “fiat currency”, “reserves”, “exceptional liquidity on tier-one exchanges” and “enabling consumers to purchase products and services”.  Similarly, the whitepaper of DAI, a crypto-backed stablecoin, focuses on its issuance process and applications, emphasizing “excess collateral”, “smart contracts”, “DeFi platforms” and “functionalities”. For the algorithmic stablecoin AMPL, keywords included “does not require any collateral”, “automatically increases or decreases supply”, “protocol” and “decentralized lending”.

Two researchers collaboratively created a preliminary stablecoin ecosystem framework (see Figure 2 An Interaction Framework of Stablecoin within the Crypto Ecosystem.) based on the outcomes of inductive analysis. The framework underwent an iterative refinement process, characterized by cycles of discussions and adjustments until a consensus was achieved regarding the structure and specifics.

Stablecoins support a wide range of use cases. After the issuance of stablecoins, users can acquire them through exchanges and engage in various activities. Users tend to manage on-chain assets through crypto wallets, while for off-chain assets, they typically choose to store them on centralized exchanges (CEXes). On platforms such as Binance, stablecoins are frequently used as common quote assets across trading pairs. Users can exchange fiat currency for stablecoins and then trade these stablecoins for other cryptocurrencies. Within the DeFi ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) provide a peer-to-peer platform for users to directly swap stablecoins with other cryptocurrencies. In addition to trading, users can also access a range of financial services on exchanges, such as staking and providing liquidity. Users can also participate in decentralized lending platforms, where stablecoins enable borrowing, lending, and collateralization, as well as engage with other decentralized applications (DApps). Stablecoins extend beyond the crypto market to daily life. They can be easily transferred between individuals, simplifying international remittances and providing a convenient payment option for everyday purchases.
