## Ethics
Our study plans and data protection measures were thoroughly reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB) to safeguard against undue participant risk. 

### Study 2 Interview Study:
Study 2 employs semi-structured interviews to enhance the understanding of user experiences with stablecoins. The key benefit of this qualitative research method lies in its ability to capture authentic feedback from users, which is crucial for a deep understanding of user behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions. The empirical insights derived from these interviews offer a detailed view of users' real-world experiences.

Although semi-structured interviews provide valuable insights, they also come with certain risks that need careful ethical consideration. Since the interviews involve discussing personal experiences in crypto, there is a risk that participants may feel uncomfortable or pressured to respond in a certain way, particularly if sensitive topics are discussed. Another potential risk is the leakage of personal information, as participants may inadvertently share details that could reveal their identity or other sensitive data.

We took several steps to mitigate these risks. First, participants were required to read and sign a detailed consent form before the interviews, which outlined the data collection process, emphasized the voluntary nature of their participation, and assured them of their right to withdraw at any time. As a token of appreciation for their participation, each participant was compensated with a $20 reward. Second, users’ email addresses were used only for interview scheduling, and we recorded pseudonyms, not public identifiers, with the raw data to ensure confidentiality. All collected data were securely stored on a university server, accessible only to our research team. Additionally, during the analysis phase, identifying details were either removed or altered to prevent any potential identification of participants. In the manuscript, we carefully paraphrased quotes from the interviewees to further safeguard their anonymity..

### Study 3 Online Discussion Data Analysis :
Study 3 involves the collection and categorization of public data from the Reddit platform. This approach offers the advantage of capturing a diverse spectrum of public perceptions and discussions, given Reddit’s extensive user base, which spans various geographic regions and cultural backgrounds. The diversity of perspectives available on Reddit effectively complementing the more targeted findings obtained from the semi-structured interviews. 

However, this method also presents certain ethical risks. A primary concern is the potential for infringing on user privacy, as individuals may not anticipate their publicly available posts being utilized for research purposes. 

To take action to protect users’ privacy and to conform to relevant research community norms [^1], we take several steps to better inform our data collection, data analysis, and paper writing practices to best protect user anonymity and privacy. The detailed practices we employed included (1) unlinking usernames fromthe data in the corpus before conducting analysis, (2) avoiding the use of usernames to search forusers’ other information during and after this study, and (3) paraphrasing quotes in our paper.
